    "last-assistant-message": "Investigated the persistent yosys `basic03` failure by tracing the LTL core and externalized register ordering, and documented the posedge gating behavior in the plan/changelog. Despite posedge gating for checks and delay/past buffers, `basic03` still reports a violation; the counterexample model suggests a deeper semantics mismatch (likely in LTLToCore or register/value alignment).\n\nFiles updated\n- Documented the BMC posedge gating work in `CHANGELOG.md`.\n- Tracked the ongoing posedge gating and basic03 investigation in `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.\n\nLimitations still present\n- `yosys/tests/sva/basic03` pass case still fails; likely in LTLToCore semantics or the BMC interpretation of the LTL monitor registers.\n- Unbounded delay `##[m:$]`, goto, and non\u2011consecutive repetition still need full multi\u2011step BMC support.\n- Multi\u2011clock, `disable iff`, and robust trace/counterexample dumps are still missing.\n- External suites (`~/mbit/*avip*`, `~/sv-tests`, `~/verilator-verification`, full `~/yosys/tests/sva`) not yet run in this iteration.\n\nTests run\n- `build/bin/circt-opt test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/verif-to-smt.mlir --convert-verif-to-smt --reconcile-unrealized-casts -allow-unregistered-dialect | llvm/build/bin/FileCheck test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/verif-to-smt.mlir`\n- `build/bin/circt-opt test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/bmc-delay-posedge.mlir --convert-verif-to-smt --reconcile-unrealized-casts -allow-unregistered-dialect | llvm/build/bin/FileCheck test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/bmc-delay-posedge.mlir`\n- `TEST_FILTER=basic03 utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_bmc.sh` (still FAIL(pass))\n- `IGNORE_ASSERTS_UNTIL=2 TEST_FILTER=basic03 utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_bmc.sh` (still FAIL(pass))\n- `circt-bmc -b 3 --rising-clocks-only --ignore-asserts-until=1 \u2026` (still FAIL; diagnostic)\n- `circt-bmc -b 3 --print-solver-output \u2026` (captured model; diagnostic)\n\nNotes\n- `lib/Conversion/MooreToCore/MooreToCore.cpp` is modified in the worktree but I didn\u2019t touch it.\n\nNext steps I recommend (pick one)\n1. Instrument `VerifToSMT`/`circt-bmc` to dump a per\u2011cycle trace for the failing assertion in `basic03` (map SMT model back to signal names).\n2. Audit `lower-ltl-to-core` for `|=>` with `$past` and confirm monitor/state initialization and update semantics; add a targeted regression if a bug is found.\n3. Start running the external suites (yosys SVA batch, sv\u2011tests SVA tags, verilator\u2011verification asserts/sequences) and capture a baseline xfail list.",
