    "last-assistant-message": "Here\u2019s a concrete, test\u2011driven next segment that keeps us aligned with the plan, surfaces limitations, and lays out the long\u2011term feature work. I\u2019ll keep it actionable and continue without pausing for permission.\n\n**Immediate next work (test\u2011driven loop)**\n- **Make `yosys/tests/sva` the tight loop:** run only the smallest failing test first, fix, add CIRCT regression, then expand.  \n- **Add a minimal per\u2011feature CIRCT regression** in `test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/` or `test/Conversion/ImportVerilog/` each time.  \n- **Record gaps** in `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` as soon as a feature lands or a limitation is identified.\n\n**Concrete test commands (ready to run)**\n- `~/yosys/tests/sva`:  \n  - `utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_bmc.sh`  \n  - Optional: `TEST_FILTER=basic03 utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_bmc.sh`\n- `~/sv-tests`:  \n  - `~/sv-tests/run-circt-bmc.sh` (or whatever wrapper exists; I can locate it and standardize)\n- `~/verilator-verification`:  \n  - `~/verilator-verification/run-circt-bmc.sh` (same; I can add a wrapper if missing)\n- `~/mbit/*avip*`:  \n  - `~/mbit/<avip>/run-circt-bmc.sh` (or integrate into a common `tools/` script)\n\nIf wrappers don\u2019t exist, I\u2019ll add a small `utils/run_sva_suites.sh` that standardizes logging, exit codes, and result summaries.\n\n**Limitations to track (near\u2011term blockers)**\n- Front\u2011end robustness: event controls + 4\u2011state lowers (ongoing crash class).  \n- Unbounded timing: `##[m:$]` still needs correct bounded interpretation inside BMC.  \n- Repeat/goto semantics (`[*]`, `[->]`, `[=]`) not fully covered.  \n- Vacuity/strong/weak + `disable iff` semantics not fully verified across suites.\n\n**Features to build next (long\u2011term, ordered)**\n1. **Complete timing semantics**: `##[m:n]`, `##[m:$]`, `[*]`, `[->]`, `[=]` with precise BMC encoding.  \n2. **Property operators**: `disable iff`, strong/weak, `within`, `throughout`, `until/release`.  \n3. **Vacuity handling**: make explicit and testable in BMC results.  \n4. **Performance**: tighter SMT encoding (push/pop scopes, shared subterms), incremental BMC.  \n5. **Suite coverage**: expand to `sv-tests` and `verilator-verification`, then `mbit` integration.\n\nIf you want, I\u2019ll proceed by:  \n- writing a single wrapper script for all suites (consistent logs + failure filters),  \n- running `yosys/tests/sva` first and fixing the current crash,  \n- adding the next regression test before touching the next feature.",
