    "last-assistant-message": "Updated the BMC goto/non\u2011consecutive repeat regression to match the current SMT types (delay buffers now lower to `!smt.bool` with `smt.constant false`) and reflected the extra test coverage in the changelog. This keeps the FileCheck expectations aligned with the post\u2011fix lowering.\n\nDetails:\n- Adjusted FileCheck patterns to expect `smt.constant false` and `!smt.bool` buffer types in `test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/bmc-multistep-goto-repeat.mlir`.\n- Noted the extra regression in `CHANGELOG.md`.\n\nTests run:\n- `./build/bin/circt-opt test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/bmc-multistep-goto-repeat.mlir --convert-verif-to-smt --reconcile-unrealized-casts -allow-unregistered-dialect`\n\nLimitations still open + long\u2011term features to build:\n- Multi\u2011step BMC still uses approximations for temporal obligations; we need full obligation buffering with explicit X/Z semantics.\n- Multi\u2011clock BMC still needs manual clock mapping; long\u2011term we need automatic clock provenance and per\u2011reg clock association.\n- LEC pipeline still needs richer LLHD ref/multidrive modeling and structured counterexample reporting.\n\nSuggested next steps:\n1. Run `utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_bmc.sh` and `utils/run_sv_tests_circt_bmc.sh` to validate BMC regressions.\n2. Run the LEC smoke scripts (`utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_lec.sh`, `utils/run_sv_tests_circt_lec.sh`, `utils/run_verilator_verification_circt_lec.sh`) to confirm LEC stability.\n3. Schedule the larger suite runs on `~/mbit/*avip*`, `~/sv-tests/`, `~/verilator-verification/`, `~/yosys/tests/`, and `~/opentitan/` when convenient.",
