    "last-assistant-message": "Implemented posedge-only BMC checking for non\u2011`rising-clocks-only` mode so clocked assertions aren\u2019t evaluated on falling edges, and updated the VerifToSMT regression expectations accordingly. This targets the remaining `basic03` false violation by preventing half\u2011cycle sampling mismatches. Changes are in `lib/Conversion/VerifToSMT/VerifToSMT.cpp` and `test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/verif-to-smt.mlir`, with updates in `CHANGELOG.md` and `PROJECT_PLAN.md`.\n\nLimits still outstanding (relevant to SVA correctness)\n- `basic03` pass case still needs re\u2011run to confirm the fix.\n- Unbounded delays `##[m:$]` remain approximate; goto/non\u2011consecutive repeats still incomplete.\n- Multi\u2011clock and precise sampled\u2011value alignment beyond single clock aren\u2019t supported.\n- Counterexample trace quality and stable naming still need work.\n\nBlocking issue\n- `build/bin/circt-opt`, `build/bin/circt-bmc`, and `build/bin/circt-verilog` are currently 0\u2011byte files, so I can\u2019t run or re\u2011run any tests. I didn\u2019t change these; it looks like an external interruption.\n\nHow you want to proceed?\n1. I rebuild the tools (`ninja -C build circt-opt circt-bmc circt-verilog`) and rerun `TEST_FILTER=basic03 utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_bmc.sh`.\n2. I continue with source\u2011level analysis only and wait for whoever is touching the build artifacts.\n3. You handle the rebuild and tell me when to re\u2011test.\n\nNo tests run after this change because of the tool binaries issue.\n\nNotes\n- Unrelated modified files exist in the tree (e.g., `lib/Conversion/MooreToCore/MooreToCore.cpp`, `tools/circt-sim/LLHDProcessInterpreter.cpp`), untouched by me.\n- Changelog and plan were updated as requested.\n\nIf you pick option 1, I\u2019ll re\u2011run yosys `basic03` (pass/fail), update the plan, and then move to unbounded delay and repeat/goto support with new targeted tests.",
