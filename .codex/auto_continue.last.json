    "last-assistant-message": "Got it. I\u2019ll ignore the unrelated local changes and proceed.\n\nHere\u2019s a more detailed, long\u2011term SVA support plan, aligned with the project plan and focused on end\u2011to\u2011end correctness. I\u2019ll keep `PROJECT_PLAN.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` updated as each track lands.\n\n**SVA Support Plan (Full Roadmap)**  \n- **Track A: Ground truth & visibility (now)**\n  - Add counterexample/trace extraction in `circt-bmc` so failures like `basic03` are explainable in terms of per\u2011cycle values.\n  - Add a minimal \u201cSVA progress dashboard\u201d file listing which constructs pass in yosys/sv-tests/verilator suites.\n  - Add a handful of targeted unit tests to lock semantics for `$past`, `|=>`, `##`, and `[*]`.\n\n- **Track B: Core clocking semantics**\n  - Make clock sampling consistent across BMC, LTL, and verif lowering (posedge semantics and ignore\u2011asserts\u2011until).\n  - Implement `disable iff` (guarded property evaluation) with correct vacuity behavior.\n  - Fix end\u2011of\u2011trace obligations for implication and `eventually` so \u201cfinal step\u201d checks are correct.\n\n- **Track C: Temporal operators (must\u2011have SVA subset)**\n  - `##N` and `##[m:n]` (bounded) fully correct.\n  - `##[m:$]` (unbounded) supported within BMC bounds (bounded approximation).\n  - `[*]` and `[*m:n]` (repeat), plus `first_match`.\n  - `until`, `s_until`, `throughout`, `within`.\n\n- **Track D: Multi\u2011clock & clocking blocks**\n  - Support multiple explicit clocks and derived clocks.\n  - Clocking blocks and clocking events (including `@posedge`/`@negedge`).\n  - Correctly propagate clock domain to sequences and properties.\n\n- **Track E: X/unknown and 4\u2011state correctness**\n  - Ensure X\u2011prop matches SVA semantics (especially with `$past` and disables).\n  - Validate interactions with `assume` and unknown\u2011bit constraints.\n\n- **Track F: Scaling and convergence**\n  - Reduce solver load: slicing, simplification, and common\u2011subexpr sharing in SMT.\n  - Optional k\u2011induction path for \u201calways\u201d properties (future\u2011proofing).\n\n- **Track G: End\u2011to\u2011end suite integration**\n  - Continuous run of yosys/sv-tests/verilator/avip with tracked expected failures.\n  - Move tests from \u201cexpected fail\u201d to \u201cpass\u201d as features land.\n\n**Current Limitations (top blockers)**\n- Unbounded delays (`##[m:$]`) are not correctly modeled in BMC.\n- Repeat/goto (`[*]`, `[*m:n]`) and `first_match` are incomplete.\n- End\u2011of\u2011trace/vacuity handling still causes false positives.\n- Counterexample trace extraction is missing, making failures hard to debug.\n- Multi\u2011clock semantics are not supported.\n\n**Immediate Next Work (short\u2011term sequence)**\n1) Implement counterexample trace extraction in `circt-bmc` (print per\u2011cycle inputs/regs/ltl_past) to debug `basic03` and future failures.  \n2) Fix vacuity/end\u2011of\u2011trace handling for implication + `$past` (BMC final checks).  \n3) Add unit tests for `$past` + `|=>` edge cases and repeat/delay edges.  \n4) Start `##[m:$]` bounded approximation to remove a major missing feature.  \n\n**Test\u2011Driven Workflow (every feature)**\n- Add a focused regression in `test/Conversion/VerifToSMT/` or `test/Conversion/SVA/`.\n- Add a minimal unit test for the lowering/semantic change if possible.\n- Run yosys SVA or sv\u2011tests subset for the new feature immediately after the change.\n\n**Suite Commands (regularly)**\n- Yosys SVA: `utils/run_yosys_sva_circt_bmc.sh`  \n- sv\u2011tests: `utils/run_sv_tests_circt_bmc.sh`  \n- Verilator: `utils/run_verilator_verification_circt_bmc.sh`  \n- AVIP: run project\u2011specific suite in `~/mbit/*avip*` per local harness.\n\nIf you\u2019re good with this, I\u2019ll start with Track A: add trace extraction and a targeted regression to make the `basic03` failure explainable, then fix the underlying semantics.",
