# SVA Engineering Log

## 2026-02-21

- Goal for this iteration:
  - establish an explicit unsupported-feature inventory for SVA
  - close at least one importer gap with TDD

- Realizations:
  - event-typed assertion ports already have dedicated lowering support and
    coverage in `test/Conversion/ImportVerilog/sva-event-arg*.sv`.
  - several explicit "unsupported" diagnostics around timing-control assertion
    ports are now mostly defensive; legal event-typed usage is already routed
    through timing-control visitors.
  - concurrent assertion action blocks were effectively dropped for diagnostics
    in import output, even in simple `else $error("...")` cases.

- Implemented in this iteration:
  - preserved simple concurrent-assertion action-block diagnostics by extracting
    message text from simple system-task action blocks
    (`$error/$warning/$fatal/$info/$display/$write`) into
    `verif.*assert*` label attrs during import.
  - extended regression coverage for:
    - `$error("...")`
    - `$fatal(<code>, "...")`
    - `begin ... $warning("...") ... end`
    - `$display("...")`
    - multi-statement `begin/end` action blocks (first supported diagnostic call)
    - nested control-flow action blocks (`if (...) $display("...")`)
  - fixed a spurious importer diagnostic for nested event-typed assertion-port
    clocking in `$past(..., @(e))` paths by accepting builtin `i1` in
    `convertToBool`.
  - added regression:
    - `test/Conversion/ImportVerilog/sva-event-port-past-no-spurious-bool-error.sv`

- Surprises:
  - the action-block path did not emit a warning in the common
    `assert property (...) else $error("...")` shape; diagnostics were silently
    dropped.
  - module-level labeled concurrent assertions (`label: assert property ...`)
    could be lowered after module terminator setup, which split `moore.module`
    into multiple blocks and broke verification.

- Additional closure in this iteration:
  - fixed module-level concurrent assertion insertion to avoid post-terminator
    block splitting in `moore.module`.
  - added regression `test/Conversion/ImportVerilog/sva-labeled-module-assert.sv`.
  - revalidated yosys SVA smoke on `basic0[0-3]` after the importer fix
    (`8/8` mode cases passing).
  - added support for compound sequence match-item assignments on local
    assertion variables (`+=`, `-=`, `*=`, `/=`, `%=`, bitwise ops, shifts).
  - added regressions in `test/Conversion/ImportVerilog/sva-local-var.sv`
    for `z += 1` and `s <<= 1` match-item forms.

- Next steps:
  - implement richer action-block lowering (beyond severity-message extraction),
    including side-effectful blocks and success/failure branch semantics.
  - continue inventory-driven closure on unsupported SVA items in
    `docs/SVA_BMC_LEC_PLAN.md`.
